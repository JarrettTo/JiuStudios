    long_description: `We partnered with a U.S.-based startup to create an advanced sports betting AI platform, designed to elevate the betting strategies for NBA and MLB games. Our mission was to build a tool that not only provided accurate game predictions but also empowered users with smart risk management solutions.

    To achieve this, we deployed a trio of sophisticated AI models: ARIMA, XGB (XGBoost), and RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks). These models were meticulously trained to analyze historical game data and odds, enabling them to generate reliable game predictions. The integration of these models ensures that our platform covers various aspects of predictive analytics, from time-series forecasting to decision trees and deep learning techniques.
    
    Data is the backbone of any predictive model, and to ensure our AI had access to the most accurate and up-to-date information, we utilized a mix of API integrations and custom scraping scripts. These tools continuously fed our models with the latest game statistics and betting odds, maintaining the relevance and accuracy of our predictions.
    
    A standout feature of our platform is the implementation of the Kelly Criterion. This mathematical formula helps bettors determine the optimal amount to wager, maximizing their expected logarithm of wealth and thus enhancing their risk-to-profit ratio. It's a powerful tool that guides users in making more informed betting decisions based on the predicted probabilities.
    
    The technology stack was carefully chosen to support the high demands of real-time data processing and user interactions. We used Next.js and Tailwind for a responsive and intuitive user interface, RESTful APIs for seamless data integration, and Flask to serve our Python-based machine learning models. The backend was supported by MySQL, with TensorFlow powering our deep learning algorithms. Deployment was managed through Docker, with AWS for scalable cloud hosting and Nginx for robust server management. Beautifulsoup was instrumental in our data scraping efforts.
    
    Today, our platform boasts a maximum accuracy of 71.1% and is utilized by multiple DraftKings Sports Betting Alpha Groups across the U.S. It stands as a testament to how advanced AI can revolutionize even traditional domains like sports betting, providing users with a cutting-edge tool that significantly enhances their betting strategies.
